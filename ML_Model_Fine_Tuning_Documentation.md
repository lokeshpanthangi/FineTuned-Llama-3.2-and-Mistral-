    load_in_4bit=True,
    device_map="auto"
)
```

#### QLoRA Configuration
```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,                           # Rank of adaptation
    lora_alpha=32,                  # LoRA scaling parameter
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Target attention modules
    lora_dropout=0.05,              # Dropout for regularization
    bias="none",                    # No bias training
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"          # Causal language modeling
